# About The Project

The purpose of this project was to gain some experience with Python, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code. Between my interest in productivity applications and data, Python was a recommended choice to get started with.

## How It's Made

Python with the aid of text files made this tiny little project possible. For actually understanding what I was writing, I used the help of w3schools, reddit, and the Simple To-Do list Application by Daniel Joseph.

## Lesson's Learned
- File handling is very confusing
- There were some similars between Python and Godotscript (looking at you functions) which, despite my little expermimenting, helped.
